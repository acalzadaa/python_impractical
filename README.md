# Python Impractical Projects

This project is the result of training using the book "Impractical Python Projects" (Vaughan, Lee. Impractical Python project. No Starch Press, 2019) as a guide, with this book I learned the quirks and features that most of the time get lost after your first aproach to python. I'll be updating the code as I learn more sofisticated techniques as these exercises are challenging enough to keep you tinkering for a couple of hours.
